      <p><strong>Author:</strong> James Herriot</p>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
      <p>
        Fresh out of Glasgow Veterinary College, to the young James Herriot
        1930s Yorkshire seems to offers an idyllic pocket of rural life in a
        rapidly changing world. But from his erratic new colleagues, brothers
        Siegfried and Tristan Farnon, to incomprehensible farmers, herds of
        semi-feral cattle, a pig called Nugent and an overweight Pekingese
        called Tricki Woo, James find he is on a learning curve as steep as the
        hills around him. And when he meets Helen, the beautiful daughter of a
        local farmer, all the training and experience in the world can't help
        him Since they were first published, James Herriot's memoirs have sold
        millions of copies and entranced generations of animal lovers. Charming,
        funny and touching, All Creatures Great and Small is a heart-warming
        story of determination, love and companionship from one of Britain's
        best-loved authors.

      <p>
        No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for
        improving--every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on
        habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you
        exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny
        behaviors that lead to remarkable results. If you're having trouble
        changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system.
        Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want
        to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not
        rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
        Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.

      <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
      <p>
        This military history book takes you on a journey through the
        battlefields of history, from the ancient world to the American Civil
        War, World War 1, World War 2, the Cold War, and beyond. Maps,
        paintings, and photographs reveal the stories behind more than 90 of the
        most important battles ever to take place, and show how fateful
        decisions led to glorious victories and crushing defeats. From medieval
        battles and great naval battles to the era of high-tech air battles, key
        campaigns are illustrated and analyzed in detail – the weapons, the
        soldiers, and the military strategy.

        The discovery of a dead body in the woods on Thanksgiving Weekend brings
        Chief Inspector Armand Gamache and his colleagues from the Surete du
        Quebec to a small village in the Eastern Townships. Gamache cannot
        understand why anyone would want to deliberately kill well-loved artist
        Jane Neal, especially any of the residents of Three Pines - a place so
        free from crime it doesn't even have its own police force. But Gamache
        knows that evil is lurking somewhere behind the white picket fences and
        that, if he watches closely enough, Three Pines will start to give up
        its dark secrets...

      <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
      <p>
        J. Kenji López-Alt’s debut cookbook, The Food Lab, revolutionized home cooking, selling more than half a million copies with its science-based
        approach to everyday foods. And for fast, fresh cooking for his family,there’s one pan López-Alt reaches for more than any other: the wok.Whether stir-frying, deep frying, steaming, simmering, or braising, the
        wok is the most versatile pan in the kitchen. Once you master the basics—the mechanics of a stir-fry, and how to get smoky wok hei at home—you’re ready to cook home-style and restaurant-style dishes from
        across Asia and the United States, including Kung Pao Chicken, Pad Thai, and San Francisco–Style Garlic Noodles. López-Alt also breaks down the
        science behind beloved Beef Chow Fun, fried rice, dumplings, tempura vegetables or seafood, and dashi-simmered dishes.
